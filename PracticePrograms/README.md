# TypeScript Practice Programs

---

- These are Just basic Programs to get the idea of **TypeScript** and how it is different from **JavaScript**.
- In **TypeScript** we use **Strict Typing** whereas in **Javascript** we use **Dynamic typing**.
- In **TypeScript** we can use **Interfaces** and we can implement them easily than in JavaScript.
- By using **TypeScript** we can write **less buggy** and more **easily** readable code.

**Note:** There are **TypeScript** files with **.ts** file extension and **JavaScript** files with **.js** file extension with the same name.

- That is because, when we execute **TypeScript** file using node we have to first create **JavaScript** file and then later we execute the generated javaScript file using node.
- To create JavaScript file using TypeScript file, run the below command in your terminal.

```node
tsc <filename>.ts
```

- By running the above command it will create a **.js** file and then we have to run the below command to execute our program.

```node
node <filename>.js
```
